0,Shivam18,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best laptop for basic purposes at â‚¹30k,"Basic Purposes - Online Classes , Excel sheet , basic business , Online surfing , etc.Pros -1. Original windows 11 out of the box2. Ms Office 2021 home and Student3. 256gb NVME ssd ( This is crucial for every laptop nowadays . If this is missing no matter how Powerful processor is , system will feel very slow and sluggish) Extra slot for HDD or sata Ssd4. Ram upgradeable as extra slot available5. Amd athlon processor is good for basic things its below i3 10 th gen and ryzen 3 but above pentium silver6. Dell brand value and after sales service drivers download is very easy.Cons-1. Screen is not that good as it has HD resolution . You can see pixels while reading pdf . And not that bright also2. Hinge mechanism is good but looks fragile as it don't open easily on surface which is not rigid and smooth like bed , sofa . You have hold it and open then place on surface .3. Speakers are clear but loudness is below average when compared to Lenovo and hp speakers it very timid sounding.4. Thermals are  bad but its case for every laptop nowadays . Cooling system can be better as it very important as cpu throttling can slow down system .5. Dell warranty extension is unnecessaryily complicated process .If you want better performance go for i3 11th or 10th gen with ssd combination"
